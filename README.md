# Beyond P: Understanding NP-Completeness, Reduction and Algorithmic Strategies

**Team Name:** ae ae dee

## 📚 Project Overview

This project explores the fascinating world of computational complexity theory, focusing on NP-Completeness, polynomial-time reductions, and various algorithmic strategies for solving computationally hard problems.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of P vs NP problem
- Explore NP-Complete problems and their characteristics
- Learn and implement polynomial-time reductions
- Study algorithmic strategies for tackling NP-Complete problems
- Analyze the practical implications of computational complexity

## 📖 Topics Covered

### 1. Complexity Classes
- **P (Polynomial Time)**: Problems solvable in polynomial time
- **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)**: Problems verifiable in polynomial time
- The P vs NP question

### 2. NP-Completeness
- Definition and significance
- Classic NP-Complete problems:
  - SAT (Boolean Satisfiability)
  - 3-SAT
  - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
  - Knapsack Problem
  - Graph Coloring
  - Hamiltonian Cycle
  - Vertex Cover

### 3. Polynomial-Time Reductions
- Concept of reduction
- Karp reductions
- Cook-Levin Theorem
- Reduction examples and proofs

### 4. Algorithmic Strategies
- **Exact Algorithms**: Brute force, backtracking, branch and bound
- **Approximation Algorithms**: Finding near-optimal solutions
- **Heuristics**: Greedy approaches, local search
- **Parameterized Complexity**: Fixed-parameter tractable algorithms
